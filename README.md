# Creating Interactive Web Dashboards with Plotly and Dash
As a data analyst, I have to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance.
The goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve fight reliability
thereby improving customer reliability. To this end, I use Plotly and Dahs libraries in Python
to create an interactive web dashboard consolidating two reports: Yearly Airline Performace
Report and Yearly Airline Delay Report for the years 2005-2020.
